WINDOWS ONLY

first download python 3 if you dont have it: https://www.python.org/downloads/  (Do a full installation, we need pip ALSO CHECK ADD PYTHON TO PATH)
then run the script in python (right click -> open with -> python (3.8 if there are multiple versions, but should work with any version 3.x))

the first time you run it it will install the requests library. that can take a minute

happy spamming
